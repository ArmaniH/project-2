***Tech***
For this project I used Ruby, Rails; Simple Form and Mini Colors gems.

***My Approach***
I approached Project 2 wanting to really push myself and try something I was uncomfortable doing, plus something kind of light in concept, so I came up with a simple app that records colors for everyday questions on feelings.

***Instructions***
The app is straight forward. The user can view questions added by others as well as add their own after they log in.

***Unresolved Issues***
1. When I edit an entry, it creates a new entry instead of just updating the previous submission.
2. I'd like to add a method to allow color submissions from multiple users to be saved and to display together.
3. The formatting of my table also needs work.
4.
