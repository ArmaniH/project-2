For this project I used Ruby, Rails; Simple Form and Mini Colors gems.

I approached Project 2 wanting to really push myself and try something I was uncomfortable doing, plus something kind of light in concept, so I came up with a simple app that records colors for everyday questions on feelings.

It app is straight forward. The user can view questions added by others as well as add their own after they log in.
